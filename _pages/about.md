Welcome to my homepage!

My name is Langtian (Landon) Ma and I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.wisc.edu) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu). Before coming to Madison, I received my B.Sc with honors in Statistics at [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/) (SUSTech) in China. While I previously worked on computational social science and causal inference in machine learning, I'm still exploring my research interests for my Ph.D. study. 

Actually, it is the philosophical significance of statistics that attracts me to this field. You can find my thoughts on statistics from a philosophical perspective [here](https://langtianm.github.io/blog/2024/Second-order/).
