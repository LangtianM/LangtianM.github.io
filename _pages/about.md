Welcome to my homepage!

My name is Langtian (Landon) Ma and I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.wisc.edu) at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu). Before coming to Madison, I received my B.Sc with honors in Statistics at [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/) (SUSTech) in China. While I previously worked on computational social science and causal inference in machine learning, I'm still exploring my research interests for my Ph.D. study. 

Beside my academic life, I'm also interested in philosophy, literature and photography. My mind has been greatly influenced by [Ludwig Wittgenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludwig_Wittgenstein) and Analytical Philosophy. I'm also a big fan of [Albel Camus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Camus). You can find my photography works on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/langtianma/).
