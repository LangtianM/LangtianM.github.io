Welcome to my homepage!

My name is Langtian (Landon) Ma and I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in the [Department of Statistics](https://stat.wisc.edu) at [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu). Before coming to Madison, I received my B.Sc with honors in Statistics at [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/) (SUSTech) in China. My current research focuses on **generative modeling and simulation for single-cell omics data**. I'm also interested in LLMs and computational social sciences. 

I seek strategies that address real-world problems and uncover reliable knowledge from data. I believe that developing reproducible statistical workflows and tools is as important as designing methodologies and algorithms.

Actually, it is the philosophical significance of statistics that attracts me to this field. You can find my thoughts on statistics from a philosophical perspective [here](https://langtianm.github.io/blog/2024/Second-order/).
