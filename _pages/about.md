*"Three passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my life: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable pity for the suffering of mankind."*  
*â€” Bertrand Russell*{: style="display: block; text-align: right;"}

Welcome to my homepage!

I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in Statistics at [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu), advised by Prof. [Kris Sankaran](https://measurement-and-microbes.org/_includes/team) Before coming to Madison, I received my B.Sc with honors in Statistics at [Southern University of Science and Technology](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/) (SUSTech). 

I have board interests in statistics, mathematics and computer sciences. My current research focuses on **generative modeling and simulation for single-cell omics data**.

I'm also a philosophy enthusiast with particular interests in philosophy of science and analytic philosophy. It is the philosophical significance of statistics that attracts me to this field. You can find my thoughts on statistics from a philosophical perspective [here](https://langtianm.github.io/blog/2024/Second-order/).
